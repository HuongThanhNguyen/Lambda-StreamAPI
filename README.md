## Exercise 2
 * Given a list of programmers in a company
    * a Programmer has id, division, team, gender, name
 * Process the list and categorize programers into divisions
    * 1111
 * Process the list and categorize programers into divisions, then team, then gender
    * e.g: {division_1 => {java => {male => [Programmer 1, Programmer 2], female => [Programmer 3]}, php => {male => [Programmer 4]}}
